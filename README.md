# ValueNite
A simple python program to find out the total value of your Playnite library based on Steam prices.

### Prerequisites
To use this program, you need to have a `playnite_data.csv` file that contains the names of all your games in your Playnite library.

To obtain this file, follow these steps:
1. Install the [**Library Exporter Advanced**](https://github.com/darklinkpower/PlayniteExtensionsCollection) extension by darklinkpower in Playnite.
2. Open Playnite and go to the top right corner.
3. Click on Extensions -> Library Exporter Advanced -> Open export window.
4. Rename the exported CSV file to `playnite_data.csv` and place it in the same directory as app.py.

Run `app.py` and enjoy!
